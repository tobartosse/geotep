This program extracts expression profiles of specific genes 
from expression studies in the GEO database. Its main objective 
is to identify genes that are co-expressed with target genes in 
expression experiments, even if they are not the primary focus 
of the original experiments..

The next steps enable you to integrate multiple experiments and 
define specific comparisons based on the samples. Follow the 
next steps in order.

To run this program run in the terminal
