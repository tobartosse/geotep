This program extracts expression profiles of specific genes from expression 
studies in the GEO database https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/. Its main objective 
is to identify genes that are co-expressed with target genes in expression experiments, 
even if they are not the primary focus of the original experiments..

The next steps enable you to integrate multiple experiments and define specific 
comparisons based on the samples. Follow the next steps in order.

To run this program run in the terminal

%./geotep.py

Read the messages shown in the terminal and follow the steps in order

IMPORTANT: The folders ./ALL and ./ExpPro contain results. Therefore, to run this 
program, you only need the GEO experiments saved in the GEO folder and its subfolders. 
Additionally, you need a file called 'genename.txt,' which contains a list of genes 
with geneID and GeneName. When you run the program, you will receive instructions 
on how to obtain these files.
